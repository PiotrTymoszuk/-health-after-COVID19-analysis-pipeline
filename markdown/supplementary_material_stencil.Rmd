# Supplementary Methods

## Study design and participants

The study 'Health after COVID-19 in Tyrol' (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04661462) was conducted as an bi-national cooperation project between two regions: Tyrol, the first major COVID-19 hotspot in Austria, and the Italian province South Tyrol. Between 30^th^ September 2020 and 5^th^ July 2021, COVID-19 convalescents recovering from SARS-CoV2 infection confirmed by nasal or oral swab PCR or blood antibody test were invited to participate in an anonymized, cross-sectional web-based survey [@Holzner2012] via public media call or contact with a physician. Residence in the study regions and age $\geq$ 16 (Tyrol) or $\geq$ 18 years (South Tyrol) were additional study inclusion criteria.

Analysis exclusion criteria in this report were hospitalization because of SARS-CoV2 infection and the survey completion at less than 28 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. Additionally, phenotyping of post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) symptoms and participant subsets was done with the subsets of the original cohort including the participants with a minimal observation time of 90 days and more. The scheme of participant inclusion in the study analysis is provided in __Figure 1__.

The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the European Data Policy. Digital informed consent was obtained from each participant at the survey start. The study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of the Medical University of Innsbruck (approval number: 1257/2020) and of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol/Alto Adige (approval number: 0150701).

## Measures

The study questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary team (infectious disease specialists, pneumologists, internists, neurologists, psychiatrists, dermatologists, general practitioners, public health and rehabilitation physicians). The survey recorded information on demographics (age, sex, height, weight before infection), socioeconomic status (education, profession, employment status, residence, household size), pre-existing comorbidities (`r globals$comorb %>% length` items), smoking history, daily medication (quantity, major drug types), course of acute SARS-CoV infection (contact with an infected individual, incubation time, quarantine duration, contact with authorities and physicians), presence and duration of COVID-19-associated symptoms (`r globals$symptoms %>% length` items), illness perception, symptom relapse as well as psychosocial health and physical constitution of during COVID-19 convalescence. Study variables with their descriptions are listed in __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-study-variables)__. Baseline demographic, socioeconimic and clinical characteristic of the study populations is presented in __Table 1__. Features of acute COVID-19 course in both study cohorts are presented in __Table 2__. Post-acute characteristic of the study populations is shown in __Table 3__. ## Pause

## Definitions and variable stratification

Respondents were asked to retrospectively assign the presence and duration classes of acute symptoms (absent, present for 1 - 3 days, up to 1 week, up to 2 weeks, up to 4 weeks, up to 3 months, up to 6 months and > 6 months). The surveyed symptoms were classified as (1) acute, when present in the first two weeks after clinical onset, (2) sub-acute when present two to four weeks after clinical onset and (3) persistent when lasting for four weeks or longer. Based on the self-reported symptom duration data, we calculated individual time intervals until symptom recovery.

Symptom relapse after the initial resolution, subjective convalescence and need for rehabilitation were surveyed with as a one question item each. Illness perception was queried as 'cold-like', 'flu-like', 'gastroenteritis-like' or 'not experienced before/other'. Assessment of physical performance impairment at the time of study completion compared to the time before COVID-19 was based on participantsÂ´ subjective estimate stratified as no impairment (0%), $\leq$ 25%, $\leq$ 50%,  $\leq$ 75% and > 75% of performance loss. 

For modeling tasks, the count of all acute symptoms as well as acute symptoms assigned to the particular phenotypes was stratified by quartiles as presented in __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-sypt-sum)__. Participant's age was stratified with the 30 and 65 y cut-points (young: 0 - 30, middle aged: 31 - 65, elderly: 66 years and more). For the detailed variable stratification scheme, refer to __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-study-variables)__.

## Statistical analysis

### Data transformation and visualization

Self-reported demographic, biometric, symptom and follow-up data were analyzed and visualized with R programming suite (version 4.0.3) and _tidyverse_ environment [@Wickham2019]. Visualization of the data, modeling and clustering results was done with packages _ggplot2_ [@Wickham2016], _cowplot_ [@Wilke2019], _ggvenn_ and _plotROC_ [@Sachs2017]. The entire R analysis pipeline is available at https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/health-after-COVID19-analysis-pipeline.

### Descriptive statistic and hypothesis testing

For assessing statistical significance for changes in variable strata frequency or symptom prevalence in time, $\chi^2$ test and $\chi^2$ test for trend were applied. To compare differences in medians of numeric variables, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used, as appropriate for the group number. The R functions used for descriptive statistic and hypothesis testing are available at https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/analysis_tools. If not indicated otherwise, p values were corrected for multiple testing with Benjamini-Hochberg method [@Benjamini1995].

### Symptom kinetics modeling

In symptom burden modeling, only the participants with the complete set of symptom answers were included. To model kinetics of individual symptom count contraction as a function of time after clinical onset in the entire study cohorts mixed-effect generalized linear modeling (GLM, fixed-effect: numeric time after clinical onset, random effect: participant, assumed residual distribution: Poisson, log link function) was applied with function _glmer()_ from _lme4_ package [@Bates2015].

To compare symptom count resolution rates between the individuals suffering from persistent symptoms and the participants with complete symptom contraction till week four after clinical onset, analogical mixed-effect GLM approach was utilized (GLM, fixed-effects: numeric time after clinical onset, persistent symptom presence and the time:persistent symptom presence interaction, random effect: participant, assumed residual distribution: Poisson, log link function) [@Bates2015]. The value of exponentiated $\beta_{time}$ coefficient was interpreted as an estimate symptom resolution rate, the value of exponentiated $\beta{interaction}$ was assumed an estimate of symptom contraction rate between the participants with and without persistent symptoms. Estimate significance was assessed with two-sided T test and degrees of freedom calculated with Satterthwaite method.

### Co-occurrence of symptoms and identification of disease phenotypes

To investigate co-occurrence of acute and persistent symptoms of COVID-19 pairwise simple matching distances (SMD, function _smc()_, package _scrime_)[@Boriah2008] between the symptoms were subjected to clustering with PAM (partitioning around medoids, function _pam()_, package _cluster_) algorithm [@Schubert2019]. In each clustering task, only the participants with COVID-19 symptoms at the given time point (i.e. first two or four weeks or longer) were included. The decision on the optimal cluster number in each cohort was based on 'elbow' of the sums-of-square curve (function _fviz_nbclust()_, package _factoextra_, __Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:acute-clustering)A__ and __Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:long-clustering)A__). The R tools for clustering analysis are available at https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/cluster_tools.

As presented in __Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:acute-clustering)B__ and __Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:long-clustering)B__, although the clustering structure was very similar in both study populations, the symptom cluster members differed slightly. To account for that, acute and persistent COVID-19 phenotypes were defined as the consensus set of symptoms assigned to the same cluster in both study cohorts. By this means, two phenotypes of acute (NIP: non-specific infection phenotype and MOP: multi-organ phanotype) and three phenotypes of persistent (HAP: hyposmia/anosmia phenotype, FAP: fatigue phenotype, MOP: multi-organ phenotype) COVID-19 symptoms were defined. 

### Subsets of subjects suffering from persistent symptoms

To identify diverse subsets of the study participants suffering from persistent COVID-19 symptoms, Manhattan distances (function _distance()_, package _philentropy_) [@Drost2018] between the affected individuals in respect to normalized sums of HAP (hyposmia/anosmia phenotype), FAP (fatigue phenotype) and MOP (multi-organ phenotype) symptoms were subjected to DBSCAN clustering (function _dbscan()_, package _dbscan_) [@Ester1996]. The minPts argument was set to five based on the $>2^{data\:dimension}$ rule. The decision on the optimal $\epsilon$ parameter value was guided by inspection of the 4 nearest neighbor (4-NN) distance plot (__Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:participant-cluster-plots)A__). The optimal $\epsilon$ value was defined as the 4-NN value preceding the steep increase of the 4-NN distance [@Belyadi2016].

For visualization of assignment of the analysis subjects to three identified subsets (HAP^neg^, HAP^int^, HAP^high^, based on the count of hyposmia/anosmia phenotype symptoms),the distance matrix was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA, function _PCAproj()_, package _pcaPP_) [@Croux2007] and the first two principal components were presented in the plot (__Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:participant-cluster-plots)B__). The R tools for clustering analysis are available at https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/cluster_tools.

### Uni-variate modeling

Correlation of the candidate factors (__Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-mod-variables)__) with the sum of acute COVID-19 symptoms, presence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms, symptom relapse after the initial resolution and over 50% physical performance loss following COVID-19 was assessed with a series of univariate generalized linear models (symptom sum: assumed Poisson distribution of residuals, log-link functon; remaining responses: logistic regression) was utilized. To account for the sex and age bias as compared with the general population of COVID-19 convalescents, frequency weights were implemented in the modeling procedure based on the publicly available age and sex distributions of the COVID-19 convalescent populations in Tyrol (https://covid19-dashboard.ages.at/dashboard.html, access on 13th^ July 2021) and Italy (https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Bollettino-sorveglianza-integrata-COVID-19_7-luglio-2021.pdf, access on 13^th^ July 2021) for the Tyrol and South Tyrol study cohorts, respectively (__Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-modeling-weights)__. To address possible recall bias caused by retrospective surveying of the acute COVID-19 course features, continuous numeric observation time variable (test to survey compltetion time) was inceluded in every model as a confounder.

Significance of model estimates was determined by Wald Z test and p values were corrected for multiple comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg method. Model quality and assumptions were checked by visual inspection of the residual plots. The tools used for serial modeling and model quality check are available at https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/lm_qc_tools. To obtain pooled $\beta$ estimates and their errors for the Tyrol and South Tyrol cohorts presented in the article text, the inverse variance method (function _metagen()_, package _meta_) was applied [@Borenstein2010;@Balduzzi2019].

The numbers of significant factors shared between the responses and cohorts were visualized as an upset plot [@Conway2017].

### LASSO modeling

Identification of the most influential, independent factors associated with the presence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms, symptom relapse after the initial resolution and over 50% physical performance loss following COVID-19 was accomplished with LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) 10-fold cross-validated generalized linear modeling (symptom sum responses: assumed Poisson distribution of residuals, log-link functon; remaining responses: logistic regression, function _cv.glmnet()_ from _glmnet_ package) [@Tibshirani1996; @Friedman2010].

The initial pool of variables used in the LASSO model construction based largely on the candidate variables for univariate modeling (__Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-mod-variables)__); however, two variables: 'Quality of support' and 'Contact to onset' were excluded due to over 30% missingness. To account for age and sex bias in the study populations, frequency weighting based was implemented in the models analogically to univariate modeling (__Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-modeling-weights)__). 

Model parameters were obtained for the lambda parameter set to 'lambda.1se' resulting in the output models with optimal regularization. Regression estimates of model co-variates with non-zero LASSO regression coeffcients were further analyzed and visualized. Measures of model fitness and error were derived from the cross-validated models using _assess.glmnet()_ function, pseudo R^2^ was calculated with the formula $pseudo-R^2=1 - deviance/null\:deviance$. Quality of model fit and assumptions were checked by visual inspection of the residual plots. The tools used for serial modeling and model quality check are available at https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/lasso_tools. 

### Prediction of development of persistent symptoms, symptom relapse and major physical performance impairment following COVID-19

To assess the ability of the LASSO models trained in the Tyrol cohort to predict development of persistent COVID-19 symptoms, symptom relapse and over 50% physical performance impairment following COVID-19 in the South Tyrol cohort, linear predictor scores (LPS) based on the models developed in the training cohort were calculated and the LPS prediction quality was assessed by receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis with the functions from _Optimal.Cutpoints_ and _plotROC_ packages. The optimal LPS cutpoints were determined by Youden criterion. For LPS formulas, see: __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-score-formulas)__.
